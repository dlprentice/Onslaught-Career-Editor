/// The released main-menu language-selector row — flag plus two chevrons —
/// recovered 2026-07-28 by composing retail's own draw quads with the decoded
/// retail sprite, which is a different thing from either one alone.
///
/// <para><b>Why this class exists at all.</b> The two prior write-ups of this
/// row both ended at "blocked on texture contents, which the proxy does not
/// capture", and left the row as the one main-menu element with no verdict. That
/// was the wrong conclusion from a correct premise. The proxy genuinely does not
/// wrap textures — it records quad, format and dimensions and never ink extent —
/// but the sprite is a shipped file sitting on the same machine, and the missing
/// half of the composition was one <c>zlib.decompress</c> away.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The trap, stated plainly, because it generalises to every sprite on
/// every page.</b> A draw-call inventory records where the QUAD is. What a
/// player sees is where the INK is. For a tightly-cropped sprite those are the
/// same rectangle and the distinction is invisible; for a sprite with a
/// transparent margin they are not, and the error is silent. Read as appearance,
/// retail's quads say the left chevron's right edge (179.6) runs 2.2px past the
/// flag's left edge (177.4) — that the chevron sits ON the flag. Composed with
/// the sprite, the same numbers give a 10.6px clear gap. One reading is the
/// opposite of the other and nothing in the inventory distinguishes them.</para>

///
/// <para><b>The left chevron is mirrored, and the composition PROVES it rather
/// than assuming it.</b> The ink box is off-centre inside its own texture — 16
/// texels of margin on the left against 18 on the right — so mirroring is not a

/// row is symmetric about x = 219.0 to 0.0px: 219-142.8 = 76.2 = 295.2-219, and
/// 219-166.8 = 52.2 = 271.2-219. Unmirrored it misses by 1.6px and the two gaps
/// come out 12.2 and 10.6. A 1.6px asymmetry arising from a 2-texel margin
/// difference is not something a layout would produce by accident.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Draws 8 and 10 are provable no-ops.</b> Each is a second copy of its
/// chevron at exactly twice the size, concentric on the same centre. It cannot
/// produce a pixel: diffuse alpha is 0x00 in 500 of 500 sampled rows across 252
/// distinct frames, stage-0 ALPHAOP is MODULATE(TEXTURE, DIFFUSE) so the result
/// alpha is zero, and ALPHATEST is enabled at GREATEREQUAL with reference 8,
/// which rejects every texel before blending is even reached. They are not
/// modelled here. Note what that costs a draw-count bar: two of retail's 39
/// draws contribute nothing, so 39 is not the number of things a renderer must
/// produce.</para>
