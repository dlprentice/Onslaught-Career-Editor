    // Beat 9: what was measured on the way to clearing it, including the
    // things that did not work. Kept here rather than in a note because the
    // note is not in this repository and these are expensive to re-derive.
    //
    // WHAT THE OLD DRIVER WAS ACTUALLY DOING, from 1,957 ticks of telemetry:
    //   - median |yaw error| 0.79 rad, upper quartile 1.99, against a fire
    //     tolerance of 0.02-0.15. A firing solution existed on 7.3 % of ticks.
    //   - nineteen target switches, ten of them steps of more than two radians
    //     taken at a slant of 4-15 m. At t13605 the driver held 0.046 rad on
    //     drone 40; one tick later it was asked for 2.692 rad on drone 41.
    //     EVERY hull-loss cluster in the trace is one of those slews.
    //   - bank reached 69 degrees, because the yaw stick was saturated for most
    //     of the beat and Simulation.cs:1255-1259 drives roll from that same
    //     axis.
    //   - of 76 rounds fired at wave 2, measured on the swept segment against
    //     the drone origin: closest approach median 1,198 mm, and NOT ONE
    //     inside 500 mm. Two hits in the whole beat.
    //
    // TRIED AND MEASURED WORSE. All of these are single changes against the
    // shipped controller, all confined to this method, all at the same
    // 36,000-tick budget:
    //   - target selection by bearing-weighted cost with a commitment window
    //     (the obvious fix for the slews): 2 kills, 4 spawns damaged, and 0-2
    //     under perturbation. Worse than doing nothing about it.
    //   - line-of-sight-frame crab: choosing MoveX by projecting the ROLLED
    //     body-right axis (the direction Simulation.UpdateJetMovement actually
    //     applies the strafe along) onto the evasion direction. 0-4 kills, and
    //     1 spawn damaged at the unperturbed point. The frame transform is
    //     real and the arithmetic is right; reversing a crab still costs the
    //     five released seconds it takes to rebuild one.
    //   - a two-phase manoeuvre - stop strafing to get the flight path back,
    //     fly a tangent to a 14 m circle, then re-strafe to freeze the path
    //     and track with the nose. This is the manoeuvre the released
    //     mechanism suggests: JetAlignmentPermille is ~0 for 120 ticks after
    //     ANY strafing tick, so a driver that holds MoveX every tick of beat 9
    //     has switched off AlignVelocityToForward - and with the mix at 1000
    //     that call puts the whole velocity on the nose in one tick, i.e. a
    //     3 m turn radius at minimum speed. Measured: 0 kills, 0 spawns
    //     damaged, and the beat ended 700 ticks EARLIER because the hull fell
    //     faster.
    //   - survive-first throttle (hold MoveZ +1 whenever the crossing speed is
    //     under what 18/slant needs): on its own, 2 kills and 5 spawns damaged
    //     and 2.2x the time alive - the best single change other than the
    //     controller - but it loses the level outright on two of five
    //     perturbations, and combined with the rate controller it is worse
    //     than the rate controller alone.
    //   - line-of-sight rate feed-forward added to the rate command: 4-6
    //     kills, never better than without it.
    //   - tightening the wave-2 fire tolerance from 1,100 mm of target to 800:
    //     six kills on five of five NARROW perturbations and three to four on
    //     the wider set. A spike, and not shipped for exactly the reason the
    //     previous 3-kill spike was not.
    //   - deferring the flight-leg landing while the descent path is over
    //     water: inert. The landing that drowns a six-kill run is not
    //     committed in FlyLeg at all - NavigateToZone toggles to walker as
    //     soon as the zone is inside 20 m, and on the Target Zone 4 approach
    //     that happens 28 m up.
    //     RESOLVED. That defect is fixed - see
    //     `ZoneHandoffClearanceMillimeters`, which gives the hand-off the
    //     altitude term it never had - and the water guard remains the wrong
    //     shape: the fix is an ALTITUDE predicate, because the morph exists to
    //     satisfy `InJetMode() == FALSE` and nothing airborne can satisfy it.
    //     The measured worry in the sentence above - "the fix is in a method
    //     shared with beats 1-8" - was real and is measured rather than
    //     assumed: beats 6 and 8 hand off at 18,969 mm and 19,759 mm of surface
    //     clearance, which is NOT "on the ground", so the diagnosis's claim
    //     that an altitude term is automatically a no-op there is FALSE. It is
    //     a no-op at 20,000 mm and only at 20,000 mm; the whole measurement is
    //     on `ZoneHandoffClearanceMillimeters`.
