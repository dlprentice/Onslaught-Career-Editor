    // They used to be synthetic single points 500-620 m out at exactly 45
    // degrees, with a comment claiming that kept Core-only tests independent of
    // retail route data. It did not: it made whole released beats unreachable
    // in Core, because every actor that follows one of these paths drives off
    // the authored map and parks in deep water where no walker can follow it.
    // Measured before this correction, with beat 3 completing for the first
    // time: the three beat-4 Target Trucks stopped at (197322, -11060, 213103),
    // (187162, -11060, 203960) and (176998, -11060, 194815) - 170-197 m from
    // the player and 11 m below the water plane. Beat 4 could not complete, and
    // beats 5, 6, 8 and 10 are behind it. This is the same class of fixture
    // defect that `Target Tank Path 1` carried until it was corrected on
    // 2026-07-26, and nothing pins the synthetic values.
    //
    // Every field is the manifest's, including the retail `nodeIndex` and the
    // retail `retailComponentsFloatBits`. The previous corrections renumbered
    // nodes 0..N-1 and rebuilt the float bits from the rounded millimetres,
    // which produces *different bits* - harmless today because nothing in the
    // movement path reads either field, and wrong tomorrow because both are
    // part of the hashed definition set.
    //
    // RE-TRANSCRIBED 2026-07-27 from schema v14, after `58d9ce57` found the
    // materializer had been resolving these node indices against the 121-entry
    // navigation graph instead of the 30 RLWD thingType-18 marker records. The
    // values below were the WRONG TABLE's coordinates: 30 nodes collapsed onto
    // 11 distinct positions with 19 aliased pairs, and every altitude read
    // +10000. The corrected table has 30 distinct positions, no aliasing, and
    // splits the altitudes {0: 26, -15000: 2, -20000: 2} - the two non-zero
    // pairs landing exactly on the two ambient AIRCRAFT routes, which is the
    // corroboration that this is the right table rather than another plausible
    // one.
    //
    // `Transporter Path` no longer repeats its leading node. That "released
    // duplicate" was the aliasing artefact: nodes 44 and 22 are 116.26 m apart
    // horizontally and 117.97 m apart in three dimensions, and node 44 is the
    // one that also carried the +178.7 m error the correction commit measured.
    // `TransporterArrival_UsesTheStrictReleasedClassRadius` used to assert the
    // duplicate AS RETAIL TRUTH and no longer does.
    //
    // `Level100WaypointFixtureTests` cross-checks every row below against the
    // materialized manifest, which is what would have caught this drift the day
    // it appeared.
    // The second argument of each row is the manifest's
    // `targetChainNodeIndices` and the third its `isClosed`. Both were shipped
    // by schema v14 on 2026-07-27 and consumed by nobody until #146: the
    // product walked the serialized `points` order, so six of these eight
    // routes ran backwards or rotated. `Flyby Path` is the visible one - its
    // serialized head, node 43, is the chain's TAIL and the only node of that
