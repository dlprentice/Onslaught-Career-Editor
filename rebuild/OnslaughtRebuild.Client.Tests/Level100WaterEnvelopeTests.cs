/// clipping to pure white and had lost retail's B &gt; G &gt; R hue rule. Two
/// uncited passes were responsible, and both had passed code review: an
/// additive second draw of the shoreline that re-applied <c>water-waves</c>
/// (the only water texture with a hue) on top of a primary pass that already
/// consumed it, and a <c>D3DTOP_MULTIPLYADD</c> stage whose operands were
/// mapped as <c>waves + diffuse * current</c> instead of
/// <c>waves * diffuse + current</c>. Reviewing the shader could not catch
/// either. Only pixels could.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why it was re-derived on 2026-07-26.</b> The first version of this
/// gate scored three FIXED screen rectangles at four offsets. That was wrong in
/// a way the camera-FOV correction (a382a8e4) exposed: the opening pan is in
/// motion, so a fixed rectangle does not stay on water. Measured over
/// <c>opening-pan-run1</c>, retail's OWN <c>open-sea-right</c> rectangle drops
/// to 65.65% B &gt; G &gt; R by t0+749 ms and to 0.17% by t0+2507 ms, because
/// the pan has swept an island and then the shore through it; retail's own
/// <c>caustic-band</c> rectangle holds 1,241 pixels at 250+ on all three
/// channels at t0+1255 ms, from snow, not water. The gate would have failed the
/// reference it was built from. It was measuring pan geometry, not water.</para>
///
/// <para><b>How the samples below were chosen.</b> A rectangle now belongs to
/// one offset, and it was selected from RETAIL alone, by exhaustive search over
/// x,y in steps of 10 and widths/heights in {20..320}, for the largest
/// rectangle in that retail frame with: zero pixels at 235+ on any channel (no
/// snow, sky glare or specular), and at least 99% of pixels satisfying
/// B &gt; G &gt; R (unambiguous open sea, not the horizon haze band where the
/// fog blend puts G at or under R in retail too). The reconstruction was not
/// consulted in the search. All six were then confirmed by eye to be open sea
/// in retail and in the reconstruction.</para>
///
/// <para>The same search says open water is only ON SCREEN in Level 100 for the
/// first ~1.5 s. At t0+1756 ms and beyond the largest qualifying rectangle is
/// sky or the blue hull of a structure, and from t0+6006 ms the settled cockpit
/// view contains no sea at all - the best "B &gt; G &gt; R" rectangle there,
