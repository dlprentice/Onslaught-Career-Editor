///     opening-pan-run1/level100-t013011ms.png holds HUD_02 mid-word at
///     "This is the threat / circle. That notch / indi".
///   * When the type-on needs a fourth line the window SCROLLS UP BY EXACTLY
///     ONE LINE; it does not page. HUD_02 runs
///     [1,2,3] (t013269) -> [2,3,4] (t013761) -> [3,4,5] (t014260) in
///     opening-pan-run1, so line 3 is the top line of the next window rather
///     than being discarded with lines 1-2.
///   * The wrap is by CHARACTER COLUMN, not by pixel width. Across six captured
///     messages every observed break is reproduced by a greedy 25-column wrap
///     and by no pixel width: "your scanner. Enemy units" (25 columns, 224px)
///     stays on one line while "This is the threat circle." (26 columns, 214px)
///     does not, so no single pixel width can explain both.
///   * The reveal runs at 40 characters per second, counting the source
///     character each break consumes. Least squares over the seven HUD_02
///     samples gives 39.67 char/s and the two HUD_06 samples give 40.28.
