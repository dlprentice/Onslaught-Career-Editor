///
/// <para><b>Nothing here is authored by us.</b> The descriptor name, the placement
/// law and the line-of-sight gate come from the pinned GPL source; the texture,
/// blend mode, radius and colour come from the shipped particle set; and the one
/// value neither source carries - how an authored <c>Radius</c> becomes a
/// billboard extent - is measured against a retail frame in
/// <c>Level100SunTests</c>. Fields the shipped record carries that no available
/// source explains are listed under "unread" below rather than guessed at.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Placement.</b> <c>references/Onslaught/DXEngine.cpp:1043-1046</c>
/// builds <c>FVector sun(hfp.SunPosX, hfp.SunPosY, hfp.SunPosZ)</c>, scales it by
/// <c>SUN_SCALE</c> (<c>0.6f</c>, <c>DXEngine.cpp:975</c>) and adds the particle
/// at <c>camera-&gt;GetPos() + sun</c> (<c>DXEngine.cpp:1064</c>). The sprite is
/// therefore a fixed short distance in front of the camera along the level's own
/// sun vector, not at any world position, and it is re-added every rendered
/// frame. Level 100's <c>SunPos</c> is already unit length, so the released
/// distance is 0.6 m; the raw vector is scaled rather than normalised here
/// because that is what the source does.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Occlusion.</b> Because the sprite sits 0.6 m from the eye, no depth
/// buffer can ever hide it behind a mountain - which is exactly why
/// <c>DXEngine.cpp:1050-1062</c> casts a 200 m ray along the sun direction and
/// skips the particle entirely unless the ray reaches open sky. That gate is
/// reproduced here against the height field. <b>Narrower than retail:</b> the
/// released test is <c>WORLD.FindFirstThingToHitLine</c>, which also considers
/// world things (the player's own battle engine excepted); this one considers
/// terrain only, so a sun seen through a building or a target still draws.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The gate is live but unexercised by any capture we have.</b>
/// Measured 2026-07-30 over the 91-frame gameplay plan: the sun draws in 76
/// frames and is absent in 15, and all 15 are the sprite being off-screen
/// rather than occluded - a control capture with the gate forced true is
/// pixel-identical across all 91. A second control that aims the probe ray into
/// the ground suppresses all 76, so the predicate does read the height field and
/// does return false when the ray is blocked. What no captured frame shows is
/// the gate firing on its own terms, because on this timeline the sun is never
/// behind terrain.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Fields of the shipped record this class does not read</b>, because no
/// available evidence says what they do: <c>Axis_Aligned 4</c> (the resolver
/// records its semantics as unresolved; a screen-aligned billboard is used and
/// the measured on-screen size is consistent with one), <c>Bounce 0</c>,
/// <c>Length 1.0</c>, <c>2D 0</c>, and <c>Velocity_Damp</c> - the last three
/// being inert for a sprite that never moves. <c>Final_Radius 1.0</c> and
/// <c>Life_Pct 1.0</c> are likewise never reached: <c>Life 0</c> means each
/// instance is only ever seen at its start radius, so the radius-over-life
/// interpolation law - which is absent from the source drop along with the rest
/// of the particle system - cannot affect this effect and is not invented.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Not reproduced, and visibly so.</b> <c>DXEngine.cpp:974</c> gates the
/// whole block on <c>hfp.VisibleSun</c>. That flag's offset inside the CHFD
/// payload is not decoded by <c>Level100Terrain</c>, so this class cannot consult
/// it. Level 100 plainly draws the sun in retail, so the reconstruction draws it
/// too, but a level that suppresses its sun would be reproduced wrongly. This is
