# Released frontend assets

This directory owns the ignored, locally materialized retail inputs used by the
bounded startup → main menu → Level 100 → loading path. Run
`npm run prepare:rebuild-assets` to verify a user-provided Steam installation
and reproduce these exact files. The payloads remain outside Git and
release packages and remain copyright of their respective rights holders;
`rebuild/LICENSE` covers reconstruction code only.

Steam's `-skipfmv` path begins at the released click-to-start page. An ordinary
launch first streams the startup movie from the ignored, locally materialized
startup cache; briefing and outcome movies remain outside this bounded lane.
New Game, Load Game, Options and Quit are working main-menu actions. Load Game
reuses the career-name/list surface over caller-injected read-only descriptors;
repeating `--career-save=<path>` is the Godot host's only input adapter. It reads
those exact named files and performs no save-directory discovery or writes.
Continue, Multiplayer and Goodies remain visible; only Continue is drawn dim.
Core/Client can carry any loaded career's suggested world and applies the
released unlock law. The current Godot selector does not render that general
state or traverse it by keyboard: its pointer path exposes only world 100 and
unlocked world 110, while the host constructs only world 100.

This lane ends when Loading hands a fresh canonical Level 100 session to the
gameplay host. The gameplay pause owner's Retry and Quit actions reuse that
loading/Main Menu lifecycle. Mission outcomes, terminal overlays, later
CFEPDebriefing, save writes/autosave, and persistent subsequent-campaign updates
remain outside this lane.

### Six rows added 2026-07-28

The table above previously listed 30 files while the directory held 38. The
five language flags and `fe-arrow.texture.aya` were absent, and they are not
incidental: they are the language selector added by commit `e9b86162`. No
existing row changed, and all 30 pre-existing hashes were recomputed against
disk in the same pass and all match. In that historical `e9b86162` pass,
differencing the table against the then-current materializer returned exactly
these six, and each hash matched both the file on disk and its pinned value.

**Corrected 2026-07-28:** the table previously excluded
`system-font.texture.aya` and `mouse-cursor.texture.aya`, and the materializer
did not produce the former. Both are now ordinary hash-pinned frontend inputs.

## Cold-start media is NOT in this directory

Retail's splash and intro FMV — `data/video/LTLogo.vid`,
`data/video/OpeningFMV.vid` and `data/textures/splash.tga` — are decoded by
`materialize_retail_assets.py --startup-media` into a cache **outside**
`res://`, defaulting to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/OnslaughtToolkit/startup-media` and
overridable with `--startup-media-root` or `ONSLAUGHT_STARTUP_MEDIA`.

They are deliberately not staged here. Everything in this directory is inside
the Godot project, and a `.gitignore` entry stops a `git commit` but does **not**
stop a Godot export from packing an ignored file into the PCK — the export scans
the project directory, not the git index. Two decoded retail movies are the last
thing that should depend on that distinction. `fe-back-128x128x30.rgb` in
`Backgrounds/` predates this lane and IS exposed to that hazard; no export preset
exists in the project today, so the risk is latent rather than active.

The reconstruction plays them through `RetailStartupSequence`, gated by
`--intro` / `--skipfmv` (retail's own flag name). Capture and smoke runs suppress
them, because every retail reference frame in this repository was captured with
`-skipfmv` on.

## Evidence boundary

- Steam Ghidra: startup handlers `0x0051B660`/`0x0051B6B0`, prompt render
  entry `0x0051B840`, main page vtable `0x005DBAE4`, level-select input/render
  `0x004606B0`/`0x00460B40`, loading renderer `0x0042C810`, and debrief
  vtable `0x005DB9C0` (`Initialize` `0x00456780`, `ButtonPressed`
  `0x004568A0`, `Process` `0x00456930`, `Render` `0x00456DD0`).
- Stuart source: `FrontEnd.cpp` establishes first-run intro, title return,
  debrief return, and initial selected world 100; `PCFrontend.cpp` names the
  move/select records; `game.cpp` establishes the distinct in-game result
  overlay. This lane does not compose that overlay or CFEPDebriefing.
- Shipped Level 100 `LevelScript.msl` defines four primary objectives,
  `LevelWon()`, and its only `LevelLostString(LOSE_TUTORIAL_BROKE)` reason.
- Startup/main/level placement, widescreen composition, and unavailable-item
  dimming are reconstruction-owned adaptations. The main underlay identity is
  the released FEBack128 Bink path (not Rock); the rebuild draws a verified
  ffmpeg rgb strip rather than linking Bink. The exact loading image and text
  are retained, but no exact layout, timing, control-hint, full pixel-parity,
  terminal-overlay, or complete-debriefing claim is made until dual-capture
  evidence says otherwise.
