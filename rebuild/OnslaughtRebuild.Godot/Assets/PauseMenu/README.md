# Level 100 pause assets

This directory retains no retail payload. The local materializer copies four
hash-gated inputs from a user-provided Steam installation to ignored paths.

## `endcurve.texture.aya` — the confirmation panel's corner cell

`CMessageLog__RenderPanelFrame` (`0x004B9010`) holds this texture at `this+0x08`
and draws it into the four 32×32 corner cells of the panel frame, with
`FrontEnd%v2%FE_Blank.tga` filling the four stretched edges and the centre.

Decoded from the 291-byte source above (one AYA zlib record, 1152-byte `DDS `
payload): **32×32, `DXT2` FourCC, no mip chain**, 1024 bytes of block data =
exactly 64 4×4 blocks for a single 32×32 level. The 32×32 read in the panel
frame is therefore the texture's native size, and matches the measured corner
scalar `_DAT_005DB2B8` = 32.0.

Alpha content, from the decoded 1024 texels: 753 fully opaque (255), 208 fully
transparent (0), 63 intermediate spread evenly across the 4-bit ramp — a soft
one-texel antialiased edge. The shape is a filled quarter disc, opaque toward
the lower-left and clear toward the upper-right, so retail flips it per corner.
RGB is effectively white (246..255 on every opaque texel; 36 distinct RGB
triples total), which is consistent with the frame being drawn as a pure alpha
mask under the measured `RGB 0, alpha 192` tint. As with every other DXT2 asset
here the label is a retail toolchain mislabel: alpha is **straight**, not
premultiplied — 31 of the 63 semi-transparent texels already have RGB above
their own alpha, which premultiplied data cannot.

The renderer reuses the existing ignored `Hud/font-22.texture.aya` and
`Hud/font-13ps.texture.aya`. Tracked Steam function summaries for
`PauseMenu__Init` (`0x004CDE60`), `CPauseMenu__Render` (`0x004D11D0`), and
the menu-range/item renderers identify the root, confirmation, render, and
input/action owners. Localized root and confirmation text was checked against
shipped English table SHA-256
`789ECFF619D077092769DF281C540D138A25FCC74D70023466A604888E59371A`;
the three option-root labels also exist as literal Steam strings.

The current renderer's 640×480 coordinate space, placement, fade timing,
circle motion, colors, and row hit regions are bounded reconstruction choices;
the tracked evidence does not establish pixel or runtime presentation parity.
Only the evidenced root and Retry/Quit confirmation flow belong to this
renderer. Message Log and Briefing remain visibly disabled because the current
rebuild has no canonical integrated panel for them. Controller Options, Sound
Options and Video Options are also still disabled **here**, but for a different
reason than they were: a panel and a live settings-mutation owner for all three
now exist elsewhere in the reconstruction. Continue
resumes the same deterministic session; Retry replaces it through the existing
frontend Loading seam; Quit returns to the existing Main Menu. No pause subpage
or parallel mission/frontend state is inferred.

> **Corrected 2026-07-28 — the state is unchanged, the stated reason is
> superseded.** The paragraph above previously read "Message Log, Briefing,
> Controller Options, Sound Options, and Video Options remain visibly disabled
> because the current rebuild has no canonical integrated panel **or live
> settings-mutation owner** for those rows." That was written before commit
> `5e82ae42` (2026-07-28); this file was last touched by `432cb025` on
> 2026-07-26.
>
> **Unchanged:** all five rows are still constructed disabled.
> `../../../OnslaughtRebuild.Client/Level100PauseMenu.cs` builds `MessageLog`,
> `Briefing`, `ControllerOptions`, `SoundOptions` and `VideoOptions` each with
> the third positional argument `false`, against the record struct's
> `bool IsEnabled = true` default.
>
> **Superseded:** both nouns in the reason. Evidence: SOURCE (this
> reconstruction's own code at HEAD, plus the pinned GPL source it cites — not a
> capture). The panel is
> `../../../OnslaughtRebuild.Client/RetailOptionsMenu.cs`, which dispatches
> `Root`, `Controller`, `Video` and `Sound` and builds the root's three page
> links citing `PauseMenu.cpp:1346/1347/1348`. The mutation owner is that file's
> `ApplyPage()`, which commits changed rows through `ApplyRow` into
> `RetailOptionsSettings`; the Godot side then acts on it in
> `../../RetailFrontendFlow.Options.cs`, which calls
> `DisplayServer.WindowSetVsyncMode` and raises `OptionsSettingsChanged`, and
> `../../FirstFlightGame.cs` subscribes to that and applies the sound, music and
> mouse-sensitivity values. `RetailFrontendSession`'s own doc comment records
> why this is the same widget tree: "CFEPOptions builds no rows of its own: it
> calls PauseMenu__Init (0x004CDE60) with mode 1 and renders through
> CPauseMenu__Render, so the frontend Options page and the in-game options pages
> are literally the same widget tree."
>
> **What is NOT claimed:** how much work remains to wire these three pause rows
> to that owner. Nothing here has been measured against retail's in-game Options
> presentation, and no estimate of the remaining job is made.
