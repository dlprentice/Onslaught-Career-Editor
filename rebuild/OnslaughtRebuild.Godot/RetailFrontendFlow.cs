        // The 2026-07-26 deletion rationale is kept below because reason (1) was
        // right and is the defect this fixes.
        //
        // Two 512x128 quads were drawn at scale (1,2) centred on (321,120) and
        // (833,120), covering x65..640, y-8..248 of the stage. Two independent
        // measurements say retail does not put that there:
        //
        // 1. It was not additive. The helper set CanvasItem.Material for the
        //    duration of one call, but a CanvasItem's material
        //    applies to the whole item, not to a bracketed span of _Draw commands,
        //    and the trailing `Material = null` leaves the item non-additive at
        //    submit time. The proof is in the pixels, not in that reading: our
        //    captured main menu held (26,24,33) at (320,0) where the page fill is
        //    (23,23,48). Additive blending cannot LOWER a channel by 15.
        // 2. Retail shows no excess there: fitting fill + gain x FEBack128 over
        //    the proven-underlay mask and splitting the residual by this footprint
        //    gives mean -0.43..+0.84 (|mean| 1.5..3.4) over 84,912 pixels INSIDE
        //    it against +0.27..+1.45 (|mean| 1.8..3.1) over 137,771 outside, on 13
        //    frames.
        //
        //    THE STRENGTH OF (2) IS BOUNDED, and an earlier draft of this comment
        //    overstated it as "retail has no such layer". An independent
        //    adversarial pass is right that a mean residual mostly constrains
        //    the DC component: a reflection texture that is near zero-mean
        //    over the footprint can
        //    carry a real gain while moving the mean by nothing, and if it
        //    correlates with FEBack128 the FEBack fit absorbs part of it. What (2)
        //    supports is a DC bound of order one level, not absence. The
        //    projection of the residual onto the reflection texture orthogonalised
        //    to FEBack128 was NOT computed and would settle it.
        //
        //    The deletion does not rest on (2). It rests on (1): what was drawn
        //    here was provably not the blend it claimed to be.
        //
        // WITHDRAWN 2026-07-27: (2)'s footprint was the whole 512x256 rectangle,
        // but the bytes put the layer inside the logo's alpha>=8 texels only. Run
        // the same regression on that footprint and the gain is 0.488/0.489/0.487
        // against 0.025/0.030/0.038 outside it. A rectangle-wide mean could not
        // have seen that, which is exactly the bound the comment already conceded.
