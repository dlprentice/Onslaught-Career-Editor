    // Retained for the record, the original dispute note:
    //
    // DISPUTED 2026-07-25 - these values are derived from the Blaster record and
    // the premise behind that choice does not survive checking. The comment here
    // used to read: Level 100 names "Paladin Prototype", which is absent from the
    // shipped table, so the GetConfiguration(0) fallback is the final shipped
    // record, Blaster.
    //
    // Measured against the shipped data instead:
    //   - "Paladin Prototype" does not occur anywhere in
    //     data/battle engine configurations.dat (sha256 58722b12..., 1514 bytes,
    //     6 records). The level never declares that name.
    //   - The Level 100 LEVEL world (RLWD, id 100 - the one carrying the actors
    //     and compiled scripts) declares "Aquila Prototype". This repo's own
    //     materializer already asserts it and raises if absent
    //     (rebuild/tools/materialize_retail_assets.py:1339). The BASE world
    //     (BSWD, id 42) declares "Paladin Prototype" separately.
    //   - "Aquila Prototype" IS present in the shipped table, so there is no
    //     fallback to Blaster to make.
    //
    // If that holds, the maximum jet energy drain below is wrong: it comes
    // from Blaster's 0.01, where Aquila Prototype's 0.012 is the right value.
    // (That prediction was correct and has now been applied.)
    // Aquila Prototype's walker weapon set is also exactly
    // {Pulse Cannon Pod (primary), Mech Twin Vulcan Cannon}, which is what the
    // Level 100 script enables at beat 3 and matches the only two weapon icons
    // the level materializes. Under Blaster the walker has no Twin Vulcan at all.
    //
    // NOT changed here. The load-order step (UBattleEngineConfigurations::Load
    // calling ShutDown first, so the later level table wins) is inferred from the
    // reference source, not measured, and correcting these constants moves the
    // pinned smoke stateHash. That needs one runtime confirmation first - see
