/// SHA-256 <c>99dbd433…b77</c>). After the 14 admitted script objects the

/// and world 110's is <c>(2, 0, 40)</c>. The header's post-zeros word is 2
/// where both earlier worlds carry 1, and the archive packages its HFLD
/// envelope inside the ERES chunk rather than WRES/WRLD; the envelope
/// payload is nevertheless the same 668,652-byte law the Core loader pins.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The BSWD chunk is world 200's own 80,232-byte base world (SHA-256
/// <c>9c0575ea…adba</c>) — NOT the byte-identical island world 110 shares
/// with Level 100 (54,669 B, <c>04c5a383…10f4</c>). World 200 is a different
/// island as well as a different overlay.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What this deliberately does not claim.</b> No per-type actor counts
/// are pinned yet: the record walk past the 54-record header was not
/// completed against the L100 reader, whose type-8/15/18/27/36/37 trailer
/// law is Level 100's. World 200's first record is a type-15 row and its
/// records carry per-record string pairs (e.g.
/// <c>LandingCraftAlpha</c>) where world 110's carried none, so the trailer
