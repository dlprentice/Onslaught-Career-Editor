# A skinned part streams a 48-byte vertex and leaves the FVF word zero, because

#   0x18 float3  normal
#   0x24 dword   diffuse
#   0x28 float2  texture coordinate
#
# Measured over all 3,203 shipped skinned vertices: the normal at 0x18 is unit
# length to 1.5e-8 and no other offset is; the diffuse dword at 0x24 is
# 0xffffffff in every one; the coordinate at 0x28 follows the same V-sign
# convention as the rigid path; and every one of the 9,609 slot words is an
# exact non-negative multiple of three whose quotient is a valid BONE index.
#

# `C:\dev\ONSLAUGHT2\MeshRenderer.cpp` in the pristine specimen
# `BEA.exe.original.backup`, sha256 74154bfa..., at file offset 0x230077).

# Re-emission: the exact inverse of `parse_cmsh_stream`.
#
# `emit_cmsh_stream` rebuilds the original chunk stream byte for byte. It is
# the only thing that can raise the mesh corpus above STRUCTURE PARSED, and it
# is deliberately built so that a byte-identical result cannot be mistaken for
# a fully interpreted one:
#
#   DERIVED bytes are rebuilt from typed model state - counts and lengths from
#   the parsed collections, coordinates from the parsed floats, indices from the
#   parsed index arrays - and then PROVED equal to the source bytes. A
#   disagreement raises `round-trip mismatch`; it is never reconciled, rounded
#   or tolerated, because a disagreement is a defect in the model.
#
#   CARRIED bytes are copied because nothing in the parsed model describes them.
#   Re-emitting them proves nothing about their meaning. They are counted in
#   their own column by `ByteAccounting` and are never folded into the derived
#   total, so the honest evidence level stays visible in the result rather than
#   being laundered into "round-trip verified".
