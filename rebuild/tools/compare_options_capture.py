"""Compare a `-Plan options` capture against the retail FEP_OPTIONS frames.

Why this is not `tools/compare_capture.py`
------------------------------------------
It was tried first, and it cannot see this page. The Options pages sit on the
FEBack128 underlay, a ~19-second video loop, so a single retail frame pins one
phase and our capture is at another. That shows up as a near-uniform background
lift - measured, every region of every page reads about +8 R/G and +18 B - which
swamps every region statistic. `compare_capture.py` reported 65-95% "material"
on regions that are in fact pixel-exact.

What discriminates instead is an INK MASK: the pixels bright enough to be glyph
core rather than background or arc. Text either lands on retail's pixels or it
does not, and the underlay phase cannot move it.

This tool is deliberately capable of failing, and it did
--------------------------------------------------------
Run against the first build of the page it scored:

    bindings grid glyphs   44.19% IoU   (half-pixel text origin: every glyph
                                         resampled into a 5px-wide run where
                                         retail draws 4 full texels)

and after that was fixed but before the column offsets were,

    label / value columns  ~52-61% IoU  (one pixel out on all three columns)

Both were found by this number moving, not by looking at the page. Do not read a
passing number as parity: what it proves is that the ink is in retail's place,
not that the page is right.

What is deliberately excluded, with reasons
-------------------------------------------
* The top-left Forseti emblem. Unidentified art that NO page in this lane draws.
  Charging it to the options page would report the same constant on every page
  forever and hide real movement underneath it.
* The retail mouse cursor. Present in every retail frame at a different place
  on each. The capture rig pins our custom cursor at (0,0), outside every scored
  band, so live operator input cannot contaminate this comparison.
Both exclusions are boxes, stated below, not adaptive masks - an adaptive mask
would be able to excuse a real defect.

There is only ONE retail run of these pages, so there is no noise floor and
`tools/score_frontend_capture.py` cannot gate them; it reports the options plan
as UNSCORED, which is correct and must not be read as a pass.

Usage:
    py -3 rebuild/tools/compare_options_capture.py <capture-dir> [--min-iou N]

`--min-iou` is an explicitly supplied regression threshold, not a retail-parity
bar. No default floor is inferred from the single retained retail run.
