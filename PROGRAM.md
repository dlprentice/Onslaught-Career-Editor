# Execution Program

Status: durable backlog under David's 2026-10-15 direction
Last updated: 2026-10-29 (the decompilation's matching concession and scope stated; earlier: the maintainer's storage name removed; earlier: the game documentation is written in onslaught-preservation, not in the frozen `reverse-engineering/`; earlier: the companion's update guidance and the published decompilation's score stated as they are; earlier: content catalogue phase 3: world bodies, compiled scripts, terrain payloads, sprintf texture names; content catalogue survey, schema, generator, levels, placements and usage, Linux CE workflow and native Windows backend/load checks completed)
Summary: the open work, its acceptance gates, and what was closed or paused, without an execution diary.

The [goal](GOAL.md) sets the direction. Capability claims belong in
[CURRENT_CAPABILITIES.md](CURRENT_CAPABILITIES.md) and checks in [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md). The queue that
ran the Ghidra campaign, the decompilation plan and the rebuild's work items until 2026-10-15 is in Git history;
the campaign's records are in the private `dlprentice/onslaught-re-archive`.

## Open work

### Godot rebuild

The rebuild's work queue, milestones and measured parity are kept in
[onslaught-godot](https://github.com/dlprentice/onslaught-godot), where it is developed; `rebuild/` here is a frozen
copy.

### Companion — CE integration

The companion is a C# application built in code on Godot 4.8 beta1 .NET and .NET 10, and organised around players: careers
with a campaign map, Goodies, career editing, cheats, game settings, automatic backups that can be put back, music
and voices, and lore (see its [README](companion/OnslaughtToolkit.Godot/README.md)). Every write into the game is a
choice made after a verified backup, never while the game runs.
[CURRENT_CAPABILITIES.md](CURRENT_CAPABILITIES.md#godot-companion--careers-settings-backups-music-and-lore) records
what is proven. Players can choose the original game or CE, manage careers and backups, and use CE's two supported
launcher settings and the steps for updating CE (the companion contacts nothing). The CE launcher checks its own signed
feed and installs an update only when the player chooses Update.

Remaining acceptance and release work:

- Exercise the Windows Godot UI. The [Linux acceptance](VALIDATION.md#companion-with-real-onslaught-ce--october-24)
  uses the real CE launcher, protected edits and the game's own Load menu. The separate
  [native Windows checks](companion/OnslaughtToolkit.NativeChecks/README.md) now cover production file/settings
  writes, real-process refusal, and CE loading the edited Unicode career. Neither is full campaign acceptance.
- Resolve the intermittent Windows launcher-version timeout: a reproduced failure waits in loader startup
  opening SDL3.dll, before the launcher's own version handling. The independently reproduced redirected-output
  defect is corrected in CE 0.1.5; it does not explain this separate startup wait.
- A human click-through and listening to the music and voices. See the companion README for the pinned source
  contract, backup scope and other limits. Public release remains at David's direction.

Any future media replacement would be a CE option (for example a CE user-data override folder), not a file swap
in an install.

Keep the companion's application code, the rebuild and private retail data separate. Beyond launching and managing
Onslaught CE, no store, account or community features are planned.

### Game documentation — ongoing

Write what the decompilation establishes as prose and specs in [onslaught-preservation](https://github.com/dlprentice/onslaught-preservation),
the one home of the game documentation, citing functions rather than quoting code;
[`reverse-engineering/`](reverse-engineering/RE-INDEX.md) here is a frozen copy. The companion's CE work (careers,
settings, launch) is the next consumer. Sections whose decompiler listings moved to the private archive on 2026-10-15 keep a pointer and,
where needed, a short summary; a fuller prose description is welcome wherever a reader needs one.

### Content catalogue

An evidence-based inventory of the game's content (textures, meshes, animations, sound, music, films, levels,
scripts, effects, interface art) with JSON metadata, as the basis for HD successors, modding, editors, multiplayer
compatibility and the rebuild. `tools/content_catalog.py` (schema `tools/content_catalog.schema.json`) surveys a
selected install and catalogues the families existing parsers read; every relationship names the loader function or
data that establishes it, and meshes and textures carry a usage summary for HD prioritisation. Its output is
retail-derived and stays in ignored `local-data/`. The `WRES` world bodies (every thing, waypoint path and compiled
mission script, with what the scripts' literal arguments name), the `ERES`, `SURF` and `SSHD` payloads and the
`sprintf`-built sky, water, detail and HUD texture names are decoded in their loaders' order. Next: the `VSDS`, `PMIB`
and `DMKR` payloads, the battle engine configurations and `sounds.sfx` tables, and the registry of named things
(`WORLD.mNamedThings`) that would turn script thing-name matches into loader joins. A catalogue is a foundation, not
the mod system or an HD conversion.

### Decompilation and native port

The maintainer's private byte-matching check matches every mapped game function with a guarded one-byte
correction to a compiled object; without the correction, one function remains unmatched. Its public export,
[onslaught-decomp](https://github.com/dlprentice/onslaught-decomp), records its own coverage with that concession,
explains the DirectX sample files it leaves out, and documents its divergences.
The function matches do not by themselves establish complete behavioural equivalence or a byte-identical linked
executable. Its native source port (Windows and Linux) is published as
[Onslaught CE](https://github.com/dlprentice/onslaught-ce) (GPL-3.0-only source and binaries, no game files). Nothing
from either is copied into this repository.

### Repository

- The public history was flattened to a single new root (approved by David); the full earlier history is a
  verified bundle and `refs/old/*` in the private RE archive. The third-party fork and GitHub's pull-request refs
  still hold the old history; whether to ask GitHub Support to purge the PR refs is David's decision.
- The split: the Godot rebuild is developed in [onslaught-godot](https://github.com/dlprentice/onslaught-godot) (the `rebuild/` copy here is frozen), and
  the game documentation is published as [onslaught-preservation](https://github.com/dlprentice/onslaught-preservation). Still to come: this repository's
  full history is bundled into the private RE archive and flattened again, and the repository is renamed
  onslaught-companion. Each step is a separate, coordinated task.

## Paused

- **The earlier fixed-point rebuild's queue** (Core/Client/Godot, paused 2026-10-15 when the rebuild restarted around
  the parity core): World 110 generalization (former P7) and player-input replay tapes (former P8). Its final state is
  described in [rebuild/README.md](rebuild/README.md#the-earlier-rebuild-history). The rebuild's scope is level
  100 only.

## Closed

| Item | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Retail RE by Ghidra campaign (generations, contracts, promotion cohorts, record audit) | Superseded by the byte-matching decompilation; records in the private RE archive. |
| Byte-matching decompilation | Complete in the private working tree (5,482/5,482); the published [onslaught-decomp](https://github.com/dlprentice/onslaught-decomp) reproduces 5,449 of them. |
| WinUI toolkit, its UI tests and CLI (former P11) | Removed 2026-10-15; the companion replaced them. |
| Campaign bookkeeping relief (former P6) | Retired with the campaign. |
| Repository preparation (former P12) | The maintainer's checkout lives on a separate archive drive; `local-lab/` and `local-data/` are real ignored children. The 2026-10-15 cleanup moved the Ghidra checkpoint and RE machinery to the private archive and removed the WinUI surfaces. |
