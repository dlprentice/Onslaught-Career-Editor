# Tools

`tools/` contains the small reusable support surface for the WinUI product,
release packaging, guarded asset extraction, format inspection, Ghidra work,
and controlled copied-runtime research. It is not a product GUI or a historical
probe archive.

Root [`package.json`](../package.json) is the command authority. Start with:

```powershell
npm test
npm run test:docs
npm run test:safety
```

## Product and release

- `winui_primary_lane_validation.py` builds the WinUI solution once and runs
  AppCore and UI tests from that build.
- `winui_lore_pack_builder.py` builds the short-path offline pack from the
  canonical `lore/` tree and the single `lore-book/BOOK.md` entry guide.
- `winui_zip_package_probe.py` builds the disposable publish and inspects the
  portable ZIP candidate.
- `generate_winui_third_party_notices.py` keeps the tracked notice draft aligned
  with restored project dependencies.

Use [`release/readiness/PUBLIC_SIGNOFF_COMMANDS.md`](../release/readiness/PUBLIC_SIGNOFF_COMMANDS.md)
for release-specific command selection. These tools do not publish, sign, or
install anything by themselves.

## Payload and output safety

- `public_allowlist_safety_check.py` rejects tracked game/runtime payloads,
  build output, raw debugger scripts, common secret patterns, and unsafe
  submodule payloads while preserving the two reviewed fixture exceptions.
- `safe_generated_output.py` provides guarded local publication for Python
  exporters.
- `runtime_process_identity.psm1` and `runtime_proof_lab_hygiene.py` provide
  process/path identity and cleanup primitives for copied-runtime helpers.

## Assets and formats

- `aya_archive_inventory.py`, `export_game_assets.py`,
  `export_asset_catalog.py`, `export_language_corpus.py`, and
  `export_video_manifest.py` operate on user-supplied local inputs and write to
  a separate local output root.
- `BeaAssetExportHarness/` is the bounded C# AYA/FBX export bridge.
- `language_dat_decode.py`, `options_entries_decode.py`,
  `cheat_table_decode.py`, and `cardid_preset_manager.py` are focused format
  inspection utilities.

Generated assets and catalogs remain ignored local material. Passing an output
safety test does not grant redistribution rights or prove format completeness.

## Ghidra and runtime research

The retained Java scripts are generic address, metadata, tag, disassembly,
xref, scalar, vtable, and reviewed-correction helpers. Applied wave-specific
mutations live in Git history. `ghidra_project_backup.py` and the provenance/
rename guards operate only on explicitly selected local project roots.

PowerShell CDB/input/profile helpers are for controlled copied targets. They
must preserve their explicit-arm, process-identity, and installed-game safety
checks. Full Ghidra stores, backups, raw CDB transcripts, frames, audio, copied
executables, and retail assets never belong in Git.
