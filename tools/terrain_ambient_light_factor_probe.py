"""Predict retail's flat terrain factor from the D3D9 fixed-function ambient term.

`CDXLandscape::Render` draws the terrain with:

  * `D3DRS_AMBIENT = 0`                                  (`0x005454db`)
  * `SetMaterial(0x0083d28c)` — the terrain-only record   (`0x005454f4`, vtable +0xc4)
    whose Diffuse is black, Ambient is 0.8 grey and Emissive is zero
    (written by the sole initialiser at `0x004eb9a0`)
  * every enabled cached light re-uploaded with `enabled = 1`, which is the
    argument that copies the light colour into `D3DLIGHT9.Ambient`
    (`CDXEngine::ApplyCachedLight` @ `0x00551200`, stores at `0x005512be`)
  * stage 0/1 `D3DTSS_COLOROP = D3DTOP_MODULATE2X` while `USE_MODULATE_2X` is set
    (`0x00513af0`), with `COLORARG1 = TEXTURE`, `COLORARG2 = DIFFUSE`
  * `D3DRS_LIGHTING` left enabled, because `RenderTerrain` only clears it when
    `LANDSCAPE_LIGHTING == 0` and that CVar defaults to 1

The terrain vertex stride is 0x14 (position + one UV pair) and carries no normal,
so the N.L diffuse term is zero and the only surviving fixed-function term is

    vertex_diffuse = Emissive + Ambient_material * (D3DRS_AMBIENT + sum light.Ambient)
                   = 0.8 * sum light.Ambient

which is constant over the whole terrain. MODULATE2X then doubles it, giving a
flat multiplicative colour applied outside the macro cache and outside the
shipped texture stages:

    factor = 2 * 0.8 * sum(light colour) / 256

`CEngine::SetupLights` @ `0x0044a2d0` enables exactly lights 0 and 1
(`0x009c68a0`/`0x009c68a1` := 1, `0x009c68a2..a7` := 0) and fills them from HFLD
`CHFD+0x107C` and `CHFD+0x1080`, each byte scaled by `_DAT_005db060`
= `0x3b800000` = 1/256.
