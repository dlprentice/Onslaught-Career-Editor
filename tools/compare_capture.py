"""Pixel comparison between a retail reference frame and a reconstruction frame.

Parity claims in this project have historically cited code paths. This tool exists
so they can cite pixels instead.

Design notes:

* It REFUSES to compare frames of different sizes rather than resampling. Rescaling
  is precisely what hides sub-pixel and layout error, which is the class of defect
  this is meant to surface.
* It reports per-region deltas, not a single global number. A global mean is
  dominated by whatever occupies the most area (usually the background) and will
  happily read "97% similar" while the menu is in the wrong place.
* It separates *structural* disagreement (a pixel differs at all) from *magnitude*
  (by how much), because a small uniform tint error and a misplaced element produce
  very different profiles and need different fixes.
