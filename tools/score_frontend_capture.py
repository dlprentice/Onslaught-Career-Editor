"""Score a frontend capture against the retail reference set, and FAIL on regression.

Why this exists
---------------
`rebuild/tools/Capture-Frontend.ps1` reported PASS iff the capture run itself was
healthy: every shot landed on the expected screen, every file saved, every frame
was the requested size, and the plan ran to the end. Every one of those is a
property of OUR OWN run. The gate proved the capture executed. **It never
compared a single pixel against retail**, so it could not detect divergence from
the target - which is the only thing a "parity gate" appears to guarantee.

That is the "gate that cannot see the thing it guards" class, and it is worse
than an individual pixel defect: while it stands, every frontend change is
unguarded against regression, and "13 startup shots byte-identical" means only
that we have not changed, not that we are right.

This tool supplies the missing half. `Capture-Frontend.ps1` calls it, and its
verdict is folded into the PASS condition.

What is scored, and what deliberately is not
--------------------------------------------
Only pages whose retail reference can actually pin them. Measured 2026-07-26
(local-lab/STARTUP-NOFMV-BASELINE-2026-07-26.md section 2.2), retail's own two
runs disagree with each other by:

    FEP_MAIN          0.11 - 1.46 %   phase-reproducible from the click anchor
    FEP_DEVSELECT     5.8  - 44.2 %   drifts
    FEP_LEVEL_SELECT  9.6  - 62.5 %   drifts

A page carrying 5.8-62 % of intrinsic disagreement with its own twin cannot
score a reconstruction improvement below that, so gating on it would be theatre.
Those pages are declared UNSCORED in the plan, with a reason and a task id, and
they are reported as UNSCORED - never silently skipped and never counted as a
pass. A run in which nothing at all was scorable returns UNSCORED, not PASS,
because "no evidence" must never render as "no problem". That rule is the whole
point of the tool.

The statistic
-------------
The gated number is `gapPct` from `compare_capture.py`: the share of pixels where
the candidate differs materially from the retail reference AND retail's own
second run does not. It is per-pixel and floor-aware, so animated content retail
cannot itself reproduce is not charged to us, while a layer we simply failed to
draw still is. `materialPct` and `meanD` against the reference are reported
beside it for continuity with the hand measurements, but they are not the gate.

Thresholds are REGRESSION CEILINGS, not parity claims
-----------------------------------------------------
Each gated region carries a `measured` value - what the build scored when it was
last measured - and the ceiling is DERIVED from it here as
`min(measured + marginPp, 100)`. The ceiling says "do not get worse than this".
It does not say the page is correct: FEP_MAIN's title logo and top-right emblem
are both ~35-41 % wrong and their ceilings encode exactly that. Reading a ceiling
as a parity statement is the mistake this docstring exists to prevent, and this
docstring is the canonical statement of it - other files should point here rather
than restate it.

The ceiling is derived rather than stored because it was briefly both: the plan
carried 30 `regressionCeiling` values, every one exactly `measured + 2.0`. Two
copies of one fact drift - re-measure after a fix, forget to regenerate, and the
gate silently guards the old build. `measured` is the fact; the margin is policy.

Honesty rules baked in
----------------------
* Frames of different sizes are refused, exactly as `compare_capture.py` refuses
  them. No resampling, ever - rescaling hides the layout error this hunts.
* Pairing is nearest-offset within a stated tolerance, and the realised pairing
  error is REPORTED for every pair. A pair outside tolerance is an error, not a
  quietly-used approximation.
* A missing reconstruction shot or a missing retail frame is an error. Nothing
  is interpolated or substituted.
* Exit code is non-zero when any gated region exceeds its ceiling, so a caller
  that ignores the JSON still cannot ignore the verdict.
