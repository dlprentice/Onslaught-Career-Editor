"""Fail if anything still promises the installed game is never changed.

On 2026-08-01 the app started offering to patch a user's installed game, behind an
explicit choice and a verified backup. That made a claim the project had repeated for
months false - and it was repeated in a lot of places.

Two sweeps by memory each fixed the surfaces someone happened to remember and missed the
rest; the second one's own commit message says an adversarial panel found what the sweep
did not. This is the third approach: enumerate, and keep enumerating.

What is banned is the ABSOLUTE form - a standing promise about the app or the installed
game. Describing what a particular flow does is fine and mostly still true: creating a
safe copy really does change nothing outside the copy, and the live trainer really does
never open an installed game. The difference is whether the sentence is about an action
or about the world.

Run:  py -3 tools/check_installed_game_claims.py            list every hit
      py -3 tools/check_installed_game_claims.py --check    non-zero if any is unexplained
      py -3 tools/check_installed_game_claims.py --self-test
