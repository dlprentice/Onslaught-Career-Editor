# Mesh, resource, and render static contract

Status: active static map

This contract consolidates the retained engine/frame, render-state, resource,
mesh geometry, and collision bridges used by asset tooling and rebuild planning.
Current corrected metadata is owned by the
[Ghidra correction authority](ghidra-full-reaudit-closeout-2026-07-13.md).
Static evidence does not by itself establish runtime rendering or layout parity.

## Baseline Static System Slices

| Slice | Contract role |
| --- | --- |
| Wave904 `texture-render-static-review-wave904` | Static-coherent texture/resource/decode/render baseline: texture lookup/lifetime, DirectX texture load/decode/upload, CFastVB dispatch/math/render, CVBufTexture/CVBuffer/CIBuffer render paths, render-state cache, render queue, mesh-renderer entry, and asset extraction counts. Verified backup: `[maintainer-local-ghidra-backup-root]\BEA_20260526-101300_post_wave904_texture_render_static_review_verified`. |
| Wave905 `mesh-motion-world-particle-static-review-wave905` | Static-coherent mesh/motion/world/particle baseline: thing/render initialization, CMesh/CMeshPart geometry and pose-cache rows, world occupancy and physics-manager lists, mesh collision, particle manager/set/descriptor rows, and mesh asset bridge counts. Verified backup: `[maintainer-local-ghidra-backup-root]\BEA_20260526-103409_post_wave905_mesh_motion_world_particle_static_review_verified`. |
| Waves1093-1100 | Recent focused rechecks tying engine bootstrap, frame render spine, state/matrix support, render queue, primitive collision, CMesh registry, and CMeshPart load/geometry rows into the current `6410/6410 = 100.00%` closure state. |

## Engine And Frame Render Contract

Wave1093 re-read the CEngine constructor/lifecycle/resource/viewpoint/deserialize surface. Wave1094 then connected the game render loop to the CDXEngine frame render spine.

| Address | Static contract |
| --- | --- |
| `0x00449820 CEngine__ctor` | Installs engine vtable, seeds clip constants, clears owned resource pointers, and initializes viewpoint-adjacent state. |
| `0x004499d0 CEngine__Init` | Registers render/mesh cvars and allocates major render resources: gamut, map textures, water, landscape, HUD/light resources, screen effects, shadows, and trees. |
| `0x00449d50 CEngine__InitResources` | Loads zoom textures, blob shadows, highlight/hit/cloak textures, and landscape cloud-shadow texture resources. |
| `0x00449dc0 CEngine__LoadAllNamedMeshes` | Reads named mesh entries, reports `Loading named meshes`, reuses existing names by case-insensitive compare, and calls `CMesh__FindOrCreate` for new entries. |
| `0x00449ef0 CEngine__GetViewMatrixFromCamera` | Calls camera orientation vfunc, builds/transposes view basis terms, and copies the output view matrix block. |
| `0x0044a020 CEngine__SetViewpoint` | Stores per-view viewport/player/camera wrapper state and allocates a `CInterpolatedCamera`. |
| `0x0044a6e0 CEngine__Deserialize` | Reads `ENGN`/map-texture chunk data and dispatches map texture deserialize/init context. |
| `0x0046e460 CGame__Render` | Coordinates split-screen/fullscreen viewport setup, `CEngine__SetViewpoint`, `CDXEngine__PreRender`, repeated `CDXEngine__Render`, and `CDXEngine__PostRender`. |
| `0x0053e220 CDXEngine__PreRender` | Prepares per-frame engine/viewpoint state before per-view render loops. |
| `0x0053e2e0 CDXEngine__Render` | Drives per-view world rendering and reaches render queue, particle texture, water, Kempy cube, overlay, and fullscreen effect paths. |
| `0x0053ecc0 CDXEngine__PostRender` | Reaches HUD/viewpoint overlays including `0x00487d10 CHud__RenderBattleline`. |


## Claim boundaries

This map does not prove runtime texture pixels or GPU upload, mesh loading,
skinning, collision, culling, particles, water, exact object layouts, source-body
identity, native WinUI 3D rendering, in-game visual fidelity, patch behavior,
gameplay outcomes, or rebuild parity. Current extraction coverage is owned by
[the game-assets index](../game-assets/_index.md), not repeated here.
