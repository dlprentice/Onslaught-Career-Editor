# Canonical Ghidra project

`BEA.gpr` and `BEA.rep/` are the reviewed distributable snapshot of the current
Battle Engine Aquila analysis database. This is the single tracked database
owner; local working copies and historical backups remain untracked.

- Snapshot date: 2026-08-17 (tenth refresh: the 65-slot RTTI vftable pointer
  cohort)
- Ghidra lineage used for the latest review: 12.1.2
- Imported Steam specimen SHA-256:
  `74154BFAE14DDC8ECB87A0766F5BC381C7B7F1AB334ED7A753040EDA1E1E7750`
- Imported specimen MD5: `3b456964020070efe696d2cc09464a55`
- Project payload: 19 files, 187,485,061 bytes
- Canonical project inventory SHA-256:
  `255be528409b915d613b922eed4d4120965e6cf134201b00910e3fb6bcd44878`
- Current rolling database `db.18627.gbf`: 68,599,808 bytes, SHA-256
  `63c6d7076a67757c1eaa81324320e32ef806bb6fe3d2987ef77e0ae2ad5def85`
  (stable prior `db.18626.gbf`, 68,583,424 bytes, SHA-256
  `fdd94fbcc6ff39189f193f39333990453c7762360dc32e4df48b3107c95fa46f`, retained)

**Reproducing the inventory digest.** The convention was previously stated as
`sha256<TAB>bytes<TAB>relative-posix-path<LF>`, which reads as line-terminated.
It is not: the digest is over the rows **joined** by `LF` with **no trailing
newline**, one row per payload file as
`sha256<TAB>bytes<TAB>relative-posix-path`, sorted by the rendered line, over the
19 payload files with this `README.md` excluded. Measured 2026-08-17 after the
vftable65 refresh against both the tracked tree and the live maintainer
project: both reproduce `255be528…` at 19 files and 187,485,061 bytes. Re-measure rather
than quote — a concurrent ceremony can move this at any time.

**Promotion note (superseded in place 2026-08-17).** This header previously still
described the 2026-08-14 HUD route demotion while its `db` and payload pins had
already been advanced by three later promotions — the stale-prose-with-current-
pins failure mode. The pins above are current; the promotion history is:
`db.18618` → 41 boundary corrections → `db.18619`/`db.18620` → 160 name
corrections (158 functions, 2 labels) → `db.18621` → 294 ABI signature
corrections → `db.18622` → **CTentacle factory-name ceremony A** → `db.18623` →
**CTentacle factory-name ceremony B** → `db.18624` → the 36-row
`abi-two-witness-arity36` SET_PROTOTYPE cohort → `db.18625` → the five-row
runtime-witnessed `name-cohort5` → `db.18626` → the 65-slot RTTI vftable
`vftable-cohort65` SET_DATA_POINTER cohort → `db.18627`, all on 2026-08-17, each
a separately authorized promotion. Internal functions remain **8,329** across
all eight: no function was created or destroyed. All eight ceremonies are owned
by the shared cohort framework's replayable specs under `tools/cohort-specs/`;
prefer replaying a spec over reading this paragraph.

**The CTentacle factory-name chain (`db.18622` → `db.18624`).** Two one-row
`SET_NAME` cohorts, run as two sequential ceremonies through
`GhidraApplyCohortManifestLive.java`:
`0x004f07e0` `CTentacle__CreateTentacleAI` → `CTentacle__CreateTentacleGuide`
(ceremony A, `db.18623`), then `0x004f0860` `CTentacle__CreateWarspiteAI` →
`CTentacle__CreateTentacleAI` (ceremony B, `db.18624`). They are **two cohorts on
purpose**: each row wants the name the other holds, so a single cohort is refused
by the framework's own `noCycle` and collision gates, and with no in-process
rollback available every non-mutating gate must pass before the first write.
Ceremony A was closed in full — separate-process readback, verified POST backup,
tracked refresh on proven byte equality — before ceremony B's gates were
evaluated. Each ceremony measured `functionsExamined=8329 functionsChanged=1
functionsUntouched=8328 columnsMoved={name=1}`, with an independent external
diff of the full 8,329-row inventory confirming one changed row, zero non-target
movement, zero frozen-column drift, and zero movement in all 29 program-scope
metrics. Evidence and byte anchors:
[`CTentacle factory-name chain`](../binary-analysis/tentacle-factory-name-chain-2026-08-17.md).

The 2026-08-14 HUD route demotion, retained for its own record: four descriptive
names (`0x00483530`, `0x004858d0`, `0x00485d50`, `0x00486940`) were demoted to
neutral `CHud__RoutePanel_T*_<address>` Tier-3 labels after sealed scratch and
current-geometry replicas, containment controls, one live apply,
separate-process full-inventory readback, tracked-still-PRE proof, and
PRE/POST/tracked restore probes. Only those
four rows' names, displayed signatures, comments, and tags changed, and at
program scope only `commentsSha256`. No boundary, instruction, program byte,
data unit, reference, or non-target function row moved. Its "rollback control"
is superseded: in-process rollback is measured **unavailable** in this build, so
reversibility is ceremony-level restore from a verified off-volume PRE backup
only. See the

The 19-file tree was measured byte-identical to the live maintainer project on
2026-08-17 — 19 files, 187,403,141 bytes, inventory `1ecf589a…` from both
trees, zero per-file mismatches — and to the independently restored,
read-only-reopened D: POST recovery for ceremony B
(`D:\BEA-Ghidra-Backups\2026-08-17-tentacle-chain-b-post-live`), which reopened
with program `BEA.exe`, md5 `3b456964020070efe696d2cc09464a55` and specimen
sha256 `74154bfa…7750`.
Future live work can make
the snapshot lag again; each refresh remains a separately authorized promotion.

The database retains program bytes needed by Ghidra together with functions,
symbols, types, comments, references, and reviewed analysis state. It does not
contain a standalone retail executable, save, debugger transcript, or runtime
capture. This canonical database is the repository's explicitly retained
analysis artifact; its inclusion is not a claim of affiliation, endorsement,
or broader permission for retail game assets. Original game-derived material
remains copyright of its respective rights holders, and the repository's source
licenses do not independently relicense that material.

Open `BEA.gpr` from a disposable clone or local working copy. Ghidra may update
project metadata when opening or upgrading it. Static database contents remain
evidence, not a claim that every inferred signature or semantic label is
correct; controlled copied-runtime observation continues to own behavioral
claims.

Expedition overlays (RO clones, wave exports, ops state, correction ledgers)
live under ignored `local-lab/` — do not commit them. Prefer **headless CLI**
exports and scripts under `tools/` for automation. Do not assume a Ghidra MCP
extension is installed or required. Mutating the maintainer project is a
separately authorized action; default posture is read-only on a disposable
copy. Promoting live maintainer DB bytes into this tracked snapshot is likewise
separately authorized.

## Promotion-tool status

The early bulk/global-initializer and target-lock promotion programs are
historical one-shot owners, not reusable current launchers. In particular,
`ghidra_target_lock_semantic_live_launcher.py`,
`ghidra_global_init515_live_promotion.py`, and their envelope, batch, scratch,
full-520, and target-lock proof helpers retain fail-closed dependency hashes
from their completed 2026-08-03–07 ceremonies. Later reviewed fixes changed the
shared backup/envelope helpers, so reviving those old programs now stops on an
integrity mismatch. Do not repair that by mechanically replacing hashes: their
receipts describe the old dependency graph and the live project is no longer in
their PRE state.

This does not block a new promotion. Every current mutation needs a fresh,
immutable target manifest plus fresh PRE/scratch/apply/readback/POST evidence.
Reuse a supported versioned promotion runner and authority when they already
express the mutation shape and all current gates; add target-specific code only
when the existing runner cannot fail closed on the required metadata or
collateral. Never repin or reinterpret a completed one-shot owner. The Mission-
registry boundary owner named above is a boundary-only reference shape; its
receipt-pinned files remain immutable.

The dated `ghidra-function-name-table-2026-07-27.tsv` also is not a current
name oracle. Nine later historical edits changed 54 rows after its original
seal, and Generations 20–23 now pin that exact dated artifact. Do not restore or
edit it in place and break frozen replay. The 2026-08-12 projection is likewise
frozen for Generations 20–23 and two receipt-pinned instruments. Use the current
2026-08-13 projection plus a fresh live readback for current names; preserve any
correction as a new dated authority.
