# CBattleEngineWalkerPart__ActivateLandingJets

Status: active static contract (factory draft)
Last updated: 2026-08-22
Summary: specimen-bound static contract for `CBattleEngineWalkerPart__ActivateLandingJets` at `0x004135e0`; packet-described behavior is retained with explicit unknowns and no promotion claim.
Evidence: MEASURED — READY packet/decompile, structured edges, closure identity, and independently recomputed pristine body bytes; runtime and source limits remain explicit.
Specimen: pristine `BEA.exe.original.backup`, 2,506,752 bytes, SHA-256 `74154bfae14ddc8ecb87a0766f5bc381c7b7f1ab334ed7a753040eda1e1e7750`.
Source File: references/Onslaught/BattleEngineWalkerPart.cpp | Binary: BEA.exe, SHA-256 `74154bfae14ddc8ecb87a0766f5bc381c7b7f1ab334ed7a753040eda1e1e7750`

> Address: `0x004135e0`

## Identity
- Body `[0x004135e0,0x00413656]`, 119 bytes, 34 closure instructions. Raw pristine-body SHA-256 `1af289a7f6c2acdbbd411f1d3e093f94a22b15d128242b0bd9a712981188cf09`; closure range SHA-256 `4793187f450f20eb8fe972f9e85fcf2cc535a3f29f68133c942d05ca593ea2c4`; packet range-plus-bytes SHA-256 `affb2b6e8862bc772499d1a588a61e27db174539d8d5943f65b6d4c6d30c8786`. All three were independently recomputed over the exact single contiguous inclusive range.
- Canonical name `CBattleEngineWalkerPart__ActivateLandingJets` comes from the current closure/register row. Packet label matches canonical tracked name `CBattleEngineWalkerPart__ActivateLandingJets`.
- Packet name source `USER_DEFINED` and signature source `USER_DEFINED` are counted provenance, not semantic proof.
- Campaign grade `C1_CANDIDATE_PARTIAL` / closure class `SEALED_STATIC_RECEIPT` / packet confidence `MEDIUM_STATIC`. Proposed promotion: false.

## Calling convention
Packet records `__thiscall` for `void __thiscall CBattleEngineWalkerPart__ActivateLandingJets(void * this)`. Register/stack placement beyond that packet declaration is not_determinable without a separate instruction-level ABI review.

## Prototype and parameter semantics
```c
void __thiscall CBattleEngineWalkerPart__ActivateLandingJets(void * this)
```
- Packet-declared parameter list: `void * this`. Parameter labels are analyst/source intent; concrete object layouts, units, ownership, aliasing, and nullability remain not_determinable unless directly stated by the quoted packet comment below.

## Return value meaning
The packet signature declares `void`; no scalar return contract is claimed. Callee/side-effect completion and failure reporting remain bounded by the displayed body and its called/indirect targets.

## Globals read/written
- not_determinable — the displayed decompile names no `DAT_*`/`_DAT_*`/`s_*` symbol; this does not prove the body has no absolute data access.

## Callees relied on / callers
- Callees: none in the packet structured array.
- Caller `CPlayer__ReceiveButtonAction` `0x004d3110` ×1 site(s) (instruction-flow).
- Structured packet arrays prove the listed direct/static edge identities and site counts only. Indirect vtable targets, library inlining, and data-driven dispatch remain unresolved unless separately named in the packet.

## Behavior summary
- Existing packet analyst comment (quoted as bounded packet evidence, not silently upgraded): “Source-parity correction: WalkerPart ActivateLandingJets samples main-part velocity, applies walk velocity limiting, and sets the main-part +0x638 movement latch. Static source/decompile evidence only; concrete layout, runtime landing-jets behavior, and rebuild parity remain unproven.”
- The displayed decompile is non-empty and SHA-256 `179e4016c7a2c9659dfe081452be2bd5aa8f9f786f33a2c967141a3ff43e9c6c`. This factory draft preserves that packet-described control/side-effect intent but does not infer unstated field meanings, units, ordering guarantees, or runtime causality.
- Structured inventory for this body: 1 caller record(s), 0 callee record(s), and 0 string-ref record(s).

## Error / edge behavior
Nullability, invalid-state behavior, allocation failure, indirect-call failure, NaN/overflow behavior, and rollback semantics are not_determinable as a class from the packet metadata. The decompile and quoted comment are the bounded static evidence; any missing branch-level edge contract remains an open question rather than an invented default.

## Runtime corroboration (TTD, bounded)
No TTD execution row exists for this VA in the bounded `ttd-deep-mine/values.tsv` corpus. This absence is not a dormancy claim and supplies no runtime semantic proof.

## Evidence
- Immutable manifest `.scratch/wave2/manifests/cohort-5.json`, row 19; manifest specimen `74154bfae14ddc8ecb87a0766f5bc381c7b7f1ab334ed7a753040eda1e1e7750` and proposed promotion false.
- Packet `D:/packet-runs/wave1-contracts-20260822/packet-0x004135e0.json` (`bea.re.triage-packet.v1`, status `READY`, image `74154bfae14ddc8ecb87a0766f5bc381c7b7f1ab334ed7a753040eda1e1e7750`); packet decompile SHA-256 `179e4016c7a2c9659dfe081452be2bd5aa8f9f786f33a2c967141a3ff43e9c6c`.
- Digest derivation: closure SHA-256 hashes canonical range text `004135e0:00413656;`; packet SHA-256 hashes that range text followed by exact pristine bytes; raw SHA-256 hashes only those bytes.
- Closure execution state `PARTIAL` and confidence `MEDIUM_STATIC`; these are inherited bounded grades, not this factory's promotion decision.
- Packet stringRefs: empty.
- Source crosswalk: `references/Onslaught/BattleEngineWalkerPart.cpp` `CBattleEngineWalkerPart::ActivateLandingJets` line 330 (`SOURCE_ANALOG`), evidence not supplied in this crosswalk row. This is source/name architecture evidence at the stated class, not independent retail behavior proof.

## Confidence
1 — exact identity, contiguous pristine bytes, digest derivations, signature text, and structured edge inventory are reconciled; field-level semantics and runtime causality remain bounded to the packet/decompile and any cited source/TTD rows. A packet/canonical name discrepancy forces confidence 0. Proposed promotion: false.

## Unresolved questions
- Instruction-level read/write direction and concrete layout for every referenced field/global.
- Complete indirect-call target set and failure/nullability behavior.
- Runtime ordering, side effects, return-domain meaning, and caller expectations beyond the bounded packet evidence.
- Cheapest falsifier: cold-disassemble this exact raw-body digest, compare every branch/load/store/call against the packet decompile and structured arrays, then run a controlled copied-runtime probe for the named input/state transition.
