# Active Goal Slice

## Current Slice

Finish the public-primary release-readiness pass from this checkout:

`C:\Users\david\source\Onslaught-Career-Editor`

This repo is the normal day-to-day working repo. The former private checkout is
an archived comparison/source snapshot, not required for normal public
contributor work.

## Current Truth

- Static Ghidra closure remains complete: `6411/6411 = 100.00%`, static debt
  `0 / 0 / 0`, active current-risk re-audit `1179/1179 = 100.00%`.
- Public source is primary and is not a sparse export. Track useful source,
  tools, tests, RE notes, wave notes, state batons, agent reports, readiness
  notes, compact proof summaries, and non-secret/non-payload scratch text.
- Hard payloads remain local/ignored overlays: actual game executables/DLLs/
  archives/media, copied runtime profiles, arbitrary save/options payloads,
  raw screenshots/frame dumps, raw CDB logs, bulky generated proof captures,
  full Ghidra databases/backups, secrets, local config, caches, and build/test/
  package outputs.
- `game/`, `save-attempts/`, `local-rom-input/`, `mcps/`, `local-proofs/`, and
  `local-ghidra/` are maintainer-local ignored overlays in this checkout. They
  are useful locally but are not public clone requirements.
- `local-proofs/OnslaughtRuntimeProofArchive` and
  `local-ghidra/GhidraBackups` are ignored junctions to `G:` archives rather
  than duplicated on `C:`.
- The public app release `v1.0.4` is published and supersedes `v1.0.3` because
  the v1.0.3 ZIP included deep `lore-book/` mirror paths
  that can hit Windows Explorer `0x80010135` path-too-long extraction failures
  under normal Downloads paths. The v1.0.4 package keeps the friendly wrapper
  layout, includes the deterministic `lore-book/BOOK.md`-linked offline Lore
  reader set, auto-detects common Steam installs where possible, and makes Asset
  Library catalog requirements clear instead of implying raw game browsing.
- Online multiplayer is still not player-ready. Host/Join remains disabled
  until distinct-endpoint command-source proof and source-bound copied-runtime
  causality proof both exist.
- Installed Steam game files and original `BEA.exe` remain read-only.

## Public Reproducible Gates

These are normal public source/release checks:

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
node --version # v24.x
npm --version  # >=11.12 <12; npm@11.12.1 is the packageManager target
npm run test:hard-payload-safety
npm install
npm run build:winui
npm run build:cli
npm run build:host
npm run test:appcore
npm run test:winui
npm run test:winui-primary-lane
npm run test:winui-safe-copy-preflight
npm run test:winui-patch-engine-safety
npm run test:doc-commands
npm run test:md-links
npm run test:public-allowlist
npm run test:repo-hygiene
npm run test:winui-notices
npm run release:profile-check
npm run release:curated-check
npm run test:winui-zip-release-candidate-probe
```

## Maintainer-Local Evidence

These are useful only when the local archive/material exists; they are not
public clone setup requirements:

```powershell
py -3 tools\public_primary_migration_inventory.py --check --private-root C:\Users\david\source\Onslaught-Career-Editor-private --require-private-root
py -3 tools\winui_safe_copy_music_decode_window_correlation_diagnostic.py --check G:\OnslaughtRuntimeProofArchive\winui-safe-copy-live-runtime\music-audible-live-20260624-144834\raw\decode-window-correlation-diagnostic.json
Get-Process BEA,cdb -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Next Executable Work

1. Continue bounded patch/mod/runtime proof work from public `main` after the
   release baseline is clean.

## Stop Conditions

- Any step would mutate the installed Steam game folder or original `BEA.exe`.
- Any tracked file would add actual game executable/DLL/archive/media payload,
  arbitrary save/options payload, full Ghidra database/backup, raw CDB log,
  screenshot/frame dump, secret, `.env*`, copied runtime output, or build
  artifact.
- Online wording or UI implies player-ready online multiplayer before required
  distinct-endpoint and source-bound runtime proofs exist.
- A runtime proof requires unavailable operator hardware/endpoints and no other
  bounded progress remains.
- A static RE contradiction appears; stop product/runtime work and correct the
  static claim with bounded evidence first.
