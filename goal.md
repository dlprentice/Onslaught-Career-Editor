Status: **ACTIVE** (full reconstruction campaign — marathon session)  
Last updated: 2026-07-15

Campaign map: [`goal.campaign.md`](goal.campaign.md)  
Slash prompt: [`roadmap/goals/full-rebuild-campaign-slash-goal.md`](roadmap/goals/full-rebuild-campaign-slash-goal.md)  
Integration baseline: pending multi-slice marathon push (builds on `d336d861`)  
Session quota: **≥5 slice closeouts** (this marathon)

## Closed ledger

| Slice | Result | Artifacts |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Walker forward | landed | v2; `WalkerSpeedPerTick=100` |
| Jet thrust | landed | v1; `JetSpeedPerTick=381` |
| Look/Left yaw | landed | v1; `WalkerLookYawRateMilliRadPerTick=3` |
| Lab hygiene OS | landed | strip helpers |
| Campaign OS | landed | `goal.campaign.md` |
| **M1.4 strafe lateral dual-accept** | **landed** | strafe-p02; v1; policy; `WalkerStrafeSpeedPerTick=101` |
| **M1.5 transform timing harness** | **landed (offline)** | transform timing module + plan; live dual-accept pending |
| **M2.1 fire cooldown scaffold** | **landed (offline)** | fire scaffold + plan; live dual-accept pending |
| **M8.3 contract regression expand** | **landed** | 4 dual-accept JSON contracts validated |
| **Marathon slash-goal ops** | **landed** | multi-slice quota text in slash-goal file |

## Current Slice

**ID:** `M1.5-live-transform-timing-dual-accept`  
**Lane:** RE live measurement  
**Objective:** Feed morph state series into
`battleengine_transform_timing_measurement` from two receipt-bound jet morph
attempts (or dedicated measure mode); dual-accept → contract → policy → Core
only if both pass. Fallback: M2.1 live fire edges, or WinUI product slice.

## Progress log — marathon 2026-07-15

### Slice 1 — ADVANCEMENT M1.4 strafe-p02
Wired `--measure strafe` (Movement/Left=Q, path-speed analysis, no Up poke).
Live dual-accept steady ≈ **3.015 u/s**. Contract + policy + Core
`WalkerStrafeSpeedPerTick=101`. Hygiene strip OK.

### Slice 2 — ADVANCEMENT M1.5 transform harness
Offline morph latency analyzer + unit tests + plan doc. No Core (no live
dual-accept yet).

### Slice 3 — ADVANCEMENT M2.1 fire scaffold
Offline fire-edge interval analyzer + unit tests + plan doc. No Core.

### Slice 4 — ADVANCEMENT M8.3 regression expand
Contract CLI validates walker forward, jet, Look/Left yaw, and strafe public
JSON (4 contracts).

### Slice 5 — ADVANCEMENT marathon goal text
Durable slash-goal forbids one-slice completion; min 5 closeouts.

**Session closeout note:** Quota met (≥5). Campaign remains **ACTIVE**. Next
slice is live transform dual-accept. Not campaign exit.

## Lane bias

| Recent | Lanes |
|--------|--------|
| strafe live | RE+rebuild |
| transform/fire harness | RE harness |
| regression | harness |
| marathon ops | docs |

## Resume checklist

- [x] Marathon ≥5 closeouts this session  
- [ ] Live transform dual-accept (next)  
- [ ] Mutate baton after next closeout
